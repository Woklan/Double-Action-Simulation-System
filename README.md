# Double-Auction-Simulation-System
Double auction is a market mechanism widely used in financial markets. Almost all stock exchange markets, such as NYSE, NASDQ, ASXand so on, use double auction mechanism for stock exchange. In a double auction market, traders(buyers or sellers) buy or sell a type of products, say shares,under the coordination of an auctioneer(broker). Assume that we consider the exchange of a singletype of shares, say BHP.

In each business session, buyers and sellers simultaneously submit their buy bidsand ask bidsto the auctioneer for buying or selling the share by specifying their bid prices and quantities (units of the share). 

The auctioneer then tries to match thesebids and determines a clearing price for each matched pair of bids.
